            <div class="faq-question">What is PickWise?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                PickWise is an AI-powered product comparison tool that helps you find the best prices across multiple retailers. Simply paste product URLs from sites like Amazon, Walmart, or Target, and we'll compare prices, ratings, and availability side-by-side. Our AI can even search for the same product at other retailers automatically to help you save money.

            <div class="faq-question">Is PickWise free to use?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                Yes! PickWise is completely free to use. There are no subscriptions, hidden fees, or paid tiers. We believe everyone should have access to smart shopping tools.

            <div class="faq-question">How accurate are the prices?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                We extract prices directly from product URLs using AI, but prices can change frequently. Our data represents prices at the time of comparison, but retailers may update them at any moment. <strong>Always verify the final price on the retailer's website before purchasing.</strong> We are not responsible for price discrepancies.

            <div class="faq-question">What's the difference between Manual Compare, AI Price Finder, and Hybrid Mode?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Manual Compare:</strong> You provide 2-3 product URLs and we compare them side-by-side. Best when you've already found specific products you want to compare.</li>
                    <li><strong>AI Price Finder:</strong> You provide 1 product URL and our AI automatically searches for the same product at other retailers, potentially finding better prices you didn't know about.</li>
                    <li><strong>Hybrid Mode:</strong> Combines both! Start with your URLs, then let AI find additional options for maximum coverage.</li>
                </ul>

        </div>
        
        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">How does the AI work?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                Our AI analyzes product URLs to extract key information like product names, prices, and specifications. When using AI Price Finder mode, it identifies the product and generates search terms to find the same item at other major retailers. The AI then constructs search URLs or estimates pricing based on typical market rates for that product category.

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">Which retailers do you support?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                PickWise works with product URLs from any online retailer, including:
                <ul>
                    <li>Amazon</li>
                    <li>Walmart</li>
                    <li>Target</li>
                    <li>Best Buy</li>
                    <li>eBay</li>
                    <li>And many more!</li>
                </ul>
                If a retailer's website is publicly accessible, our AI can attempt to extract product information from it.

            <div class="faq-question">Do you store my comparison data?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                No, we do not store your comparisons or personal information. All comparisons happen in real-time and are not saved to any database. When you share a comparison link, the product URLs are encoded in the URL itself, not stored on our servers.

            <div class="faq-answer">
                <div class="highlight">
                    <strong>No.</strong> PickWise.club is completely independent and NOT affiliated with, related to, or associated with Pickswise.com (the sports betting tips website).

            <div class="faq-answer">
                PickWise may use affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if you make a purchase through our links at no additional cost to you. This helps us keep the service free while providing value to shoppers.

            <div class="faq-question">Can I share my comparisons with others?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                Yes! After running a comparison, you'll see a "Share This Comparison" section with a unique link. Anyone with that link can view the same comparison. This is great for sharing shopping decisions with family or friends.

            <div class="faq-question">What if the comparison doesn't work?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                Some product URLs are harder to extract than others due to how websites are structured. If extraction fails, we'll show fallback data with the retailer name and a direct link to the product. You can still manually view each product and compare them yourself. If you consistently have issues, try using different product URLs or contact us.
